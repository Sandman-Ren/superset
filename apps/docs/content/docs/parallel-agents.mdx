title: Parallel Agents
description: Run multiple AI coding agents simultaneously in isolated workspaces
---

## Overview

Run multiple AI agents at the same time, each in its own isolated workspace. This is the core value of Superset — instead of waiting for one agent to finish before starting the next, run them all in parallel.

## How It Works

Each workspace is a separate git worktree with its own branch and directory. Agents can't interfere with each other because they're working on different files in different directories.

1. Create workspace A → launch Claude on task A
2. Create workspace B → launch Claude on task B
3. Create workspace C → launch Claude on task C
4. Monitor all three from the sidebar
5. Review and merge as each finishes

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Command |
|-------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude` |
| **Codex** | `codex` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini` |
| **OpenCode** | `opencode` |
| **Any CLI agent** | Works in the terminal |

## Monitoring

The workspace sidebar shows live status for every workspace:

- **Spinning** — agent is actively working
- **Amber** — agent needs input or hit an error
- **Green** — work is done, ready for review

Audio notifications alert you when agents finish. Configure sounds in Settings → Notifications.

## Auto-Launch with Presets

Set up a [terminal preset](/terminal-presets) for your preferred agent and mark it as default. New workspaces will automatically launch the agent when created.

Quick-add templates are available for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor Agent, and OpenCode.

## Subagents

Use the [MCP server](/mcp) `start_claude_session` tool to spawn subagents within an existing workspace. Pass a `paneId` to add a new terminal pane to an existing tab — useful for breaking a large task into parallel subtasks.

## Tips

- Start with 2-3 agents and scale up as you get comfortable
- Use descriptive branch names so you can tell workspaces apart at a glance
- Set up [setup scripts](/setup-teardown-scripts) to automate `bun install` and env file copying — each workspace needs its own dependencies
- Delete workspaces after merging to keep things clean

## Next Steps

- [Terminal Presets](/terminal-presets) — Auto-launch agents on workspace creation
- [Task Management](/task-management) — Manage what each agent works on
- [Workflow](/workflow) — The full development loop
