description: Organize, track, and execute tasks from a single interface

## Overview

Superset has a built-in task tracker. Create tasks, assign them, set priorities, and launch agents — all without leaving the app.

## Creating Tasks

Create tasks from the Tasks view or via the [MCP server](/mcp). Each task has:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Short description of the work |
| **Description** | Detailed context, requirements, or instructions |
| **Status** | Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, Cancelled |
| **Priority** | Urgent, High, Medium, Low, None |
| **Labels** | Tags for categorization |
| **Assignee** | Team member responsible |

## Start Working

The "Start Working" button on any task:

1. Creates a new workspace (git worktree + branch)
2. Feeds the task title and description to Claude as context
3. Launches Claude Code in the workspace terminal

The agent starts working immediately with full context about what needs to be done.

## Batch Mode

Select multiple tasks and click "Start Working" to create workspaces for all of them at once. Each gets its own isolated workspace with its own Claude session.

## MCP Integration

AI agents can manage tasks programmatically via the [MCP server](/mcp):

```
"Create a task for fixing the login validation bug"
"List all my high-priority tasks"
"Update the auth task status to done"
```

Available MCP tools: `create_task`, `update_task`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `delete_task`, `list_task_statuses`.
