## The Loop

Superset is built around a simple loop: **create a workspace, do the work, review, merge, delete**.

1. **Pick a task** — from your task board, a GitHub issue, or your head
2. **Create a workspace** — `⌘N` spins up an isolated git worktree on a new branch
3. **Work** — code manually, run an AI agent, or both
4. **Review** — check the diff viewer, run tests, iterate
5. **Ship** — commit, push, and create a PR from the sidebar
6. **Clean up** — delete the workspace after merge

The power comes from running steps 1–6 for multiple tasks **at the same time**.

## Creating Workspaces

Every workspace is a git worktree — a real directory with its own branch, terminal sessions, and port range. No stashing, no context switching.

Create from:
- **New branch** — start fresh from main
- **Existing branch** — pick up where you left off
- **Pull request** — review or continue someone else's work
- **Task** — click "Start Working" on any task to auto-create a workspace with context

## Running Agents

Once a workspace is ready, launch an AI agent in the terminal:

```bash
claude "Implement the auth middleware"
```

Or use [terminal presets](/terminal-presets) to auto-launch agents when workspaces are created.

While one agent works, create another workspace and start a second task. Superset's sidebar shows live status for every workspace — spinning means working, amber means needs attention, green means ready to review.

See [Parallel Agents](/parallel-agents) for more.

## Reviewing Changes

The right sidebar shows all changes in the workspace:

- **Stage/unstage files** — select exactly what to commit
- **View diffs** — split or unified, with [focus mode](/diff-viewer) for one file at a time
- **Commit and push** — write a message and push in one step
- **Create a PR** — open a pull request directly from Superset

## From Task to PR

The fastest path from idea to pull request:

1. Open the Tasks view and find your task
2. Click **Start Working** — Superset creates a workspace and launches Claude with your task description as context
3. Monitor progress in the sidebar
4. When Claude finishes, review the diff and create a PR
5. Delete the workspace

Repeat for every task in your backlog. Run as many in parallel as your machine can handle.
