description: Use Claude Code and other AI agents

## Overview

Run AI coding agents in isolated workspaces. Each agent works independently without interfering with others.

## Supported Agents

- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's CLI
- **Codex** - OpenAI's assistant
- **OpenCode** - Open-source alternative

## Usage

Run agents directly in the terminal:

```bash
claude "Add error handling to fetchUser"
```

## Parallel Agents

Create multiple workspaces and run an agent in each. Compare results and merge the best solution. See [Parallel Agents](/parallel-agents) for a detailed guide.

## Notifications

Get notified when agents finish. Configure sounds in Settings → Notifications.

## Next Steps

- [Parallel Agents](/parallel-agents) — Run multiple agents at the same time
- [Terminal Presets](/terminal-presets) — Auto-launch agents on workspace creation
- [MCP Server](/mcp) — Let agents control Superset programmatically
